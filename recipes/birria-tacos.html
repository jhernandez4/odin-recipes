        <p class="content">
            There are tacos, and then there are tacos. You can really put anything in a corn tortilla and 
            call it a taco, and sure, it's delicious. But if you had to make a ranking of the best, the tastiest 
            and most succulent, the birria tacos would be in first place, or at least in the top three.
            Birria is a slow-cooked meat stew, which results in a bouillon and delicious 
            meat that melts just by looking at it. Although birria is traditionally made with lamb, it has tended to evolve 
            towards veal (beef) birria, and is now the most typical way to prepare it. You can use many parts of the veal,
            but the oxtail contributes its characteristic deep flavor, and results in a very sweet and juicy filling.
            The stew, as such, can be eaten alone. But stuffed into tortillas, 
            by a healthy amount of Oaxacan cheese, and then seared in the pan with the 
            resulting fat from the stew… well, that's just another roll. And if later you take that taco and spread it 
            in the tasty and slightly spicy consommé…. I'm salivating just thinking about it.
